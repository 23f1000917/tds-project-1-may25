None of the answer is correct. can help to fix the issue\nImage Description: \nThe image displays Python code that interacts with an OpenAI API, likely for a chatbot or language model application. The code is designed to use the \"gpt-4-mini\" model to send user messages and parse the API response. It sets up headers, defines user input strings, prepares the JSON payload, and sends a POST request. The code also checks the response status and attempts to extract the number of tokens used. The user is experiencing issues as the code gives different number of tokens each time it is run.\n\n\n\n<reply|163247/46>\nHi @23f2003853 , \nPlease join tomorrow's session, we can take it there, I am not sure why you facing this problem.",

But, Externally when I check this API, I tried considerable test cases, and I am getting the output correctly. Can you please check this and give a solution. Thank You\nImage Description: \nThe image is a screenshot of an application, possibly a web API, displaying an error message.  It shows the user's API endpoint as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity`. The error message displayed is \"Error: Expected 3 matches.\"  Above, there is text with the instructions \"Make sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers\". The text suggests the user is encountering a matching issue, potentially related to a configuration problem like missing CORS headers.\n\n\n\n<reply|163247/96>\nCheck with network tab, you would see the response of api call being made, Compare that with expected output. \nRegrading question 8, you would need to check if cors are enabled, check in browser console tab for more.\nImage Description: \nThe image shows the developer tools of a web browser, specifically the \"Network\" tab, which is used for inspecting network requests. Two requests are listed, both with a content type of \"application/x-json-stre...\". The response of the first request is displayed, showing a JSON object with \"acc\": 1 and \"webResult\": {}. The image is likely used to illustrate an API call and its response, possibly to help debug or understand the data returned from a specific web request.",
    "<original_post|163247/85>\n<reply|163247/86>\nThis is regarding the 8th question. Same here, I am getting the answer for all the test cases, but then also, I am getting error in the portal while saving. Please help me out here. Thank You.\nImage Description: \nThe image shows a screenshot of a web browser and a JSON response, and an error message. The URL in the browser's address bar suggests a request to calculate a performance bonus, with parameters like employee ID and a current year. The JSON response is formatted, showing the function name and arguments used for the calculation. The other part of the image shows that there was an error fetching the API, and the error has been displayed. The context of the user's post suggests the image is related to a coding problem, likely involving API calls or data processing, where the user is encountering an issue when saving the solution.\n\n\n\n<reply|163247/100>\nOh OK sure.

For example it states in the project that \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\" The response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\"\nIf you all still have not responded, then I'm honestly not sure if this is what y'all meant.\nLast project was not clear to some extent, This time its even more vague.  \nI understand that y'all want to give different projects to help High Order Thinking skills, but if not executed properly, no one actually learns anything and we(I) just end by debugging the project statement code and question with no relevance to the project. If we wanted to do that, I could just go random GitHub repos and solve and create pull requests for a specific bug. Also we end up losing interest thinking most if the course instructors don't what they are doing.

In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.\nExample for string. Consider the table\n|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\nWill this be something like this\n```\n\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"\n```\nor something like \n```\n\"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\n\"\n```\n## HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS\nIn one question, there were two tasks.\n* Find the answer to the question\n* Enable the `disabled` text block\nIn this question, what will the answer type be?\nShould it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block\n## MORE THAN ONE FILE\nSome questions have more than one file.

Consider the table\n|Col 1| Col 2|\n|-|-|\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\nWill this be something like this\n```\n\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"\n```\nor something like \n```\n\"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\n\"\n```\n## HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS\nIn one question, there were two tasks.\n* Find the answer to the question\n* Enable the `disabled` text block\nIn this question, what will the answer type be?\nShould it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block\n## MORE THAN ONE FILE\nSome questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table. \nIn this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=question text\" \\",

    "<original_post|169029/92>\n@carlton and @jivraj, \nHello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn't even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2.

It includes an introduction outlining the purpose of the analysis, which is to track daily steps and compare the results. The data appears to be organized in a tabular format, showing steps walked on different days of the week.  The image also shows a section of the Python code used to analyze the data, specifically using the pandas library to create a DataFrame and then print descriptive statistics. Additionally, there's a visualization section with the link to a healthline article.",

But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.\n2. In **GA4 Q2**, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5.

How to handle this question.\n3. In **GA4 Q10**, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually.

Kindly verify these points before evaluation.\n---\n## \u2757 Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue\n1. GA3 Q8  \n   - Issue: The question doesn\u2019t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\n2. GA3 Q9  \n   - Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.  \n   - Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\n3. GA4 Q2 & Q10  \n   - Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.  \n   - Reference: [GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/98?u=lakshaygarg654)\n4. Output Formatting (Multiple Questions)  \n   - Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.  \n   - Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {\"answer\": \"result\"}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\n5. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions  \n   - Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.  \n   - Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\n---\n##  Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday's Session)\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:",

Platform Capability for GA Tasks  \n   - Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?  \n   - Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\n2. File Upload Example via Platform API  \n   - Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.  \n   - This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\n3. General Observations on GA1-5\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\n---\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.\n\n\n<reply|169029/108>\nThanks a lot @23f2005702, we'll try to answer these questions in Thursday's session.",

    "<original_post|169029/126>\n@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini \n1. **GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages**\n* As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address `21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. \n* To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page\u2019s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10\u201320 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process\u2014from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live\u2014takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n* However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly\u2014before the GitHub Pages site is actually live\u2014resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a **502 Bad Gateway** error, likely due to Azure's request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform\u2019s allowed response duration.\n2. **GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files**\n* A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a **502 Bad Gateway** error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure's execution time limit.\n* Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.",

Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well. \nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\nImage Description: \nThe image shows the successful API response from a local machine, specifically for Question 3 (GA2) related to publishing a webpage using GitHub Pages. The left part of the image displays the API request URL, the server response code (200 - OK), and the response body, including the URL of the published GitHub page. The right side of the image shows some instructions, hints and examples to the students.

    "<original_post|169029/127>\n@s.anand\n@carlton \n@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini \n### **Final Thoughts on Project 2**\nProject 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n1. **Organization & Structure:**\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\n2. **Deployment & Portal Limitations:**\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\n3. **Time Constraints:**\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\n4. **Sessions & Support:**\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\n5. **Deployment Variability:**\nEach GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\n6. **Effort Acknowledgment:**\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it's clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\n7. **Feasibility in the Given Timeline:**",

In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.

No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs... with effort.

We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that.

So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n[quote=\"23f2002668, post:310, topic:169029\"]\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results.

And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach.

We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional.

    "<original_post|169029/310>\n<reply|169029/315>\nHi, I have a few things to say\n## My background : \nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. \n## My Initial Disappointments with this Course\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): \n> The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n* Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn't like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\n* ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. \n* There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n## Why did I fail?\n### Last Term\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn't practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\n## This term.\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn't allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn't submit both the projects.\nIn both the terms I didn't collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn't earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\n## Me Understanding about the Course Now",

But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don't know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. \nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing `SKLearn`. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an ***implicit*** way.\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. \nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation.

What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. \nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn't do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn't cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. \nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\nThanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj  and @Saransh_Saini \n> Just two suggestions\n* I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\n* While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained.

    "<original_post|169029/333>\nDear @Carlton and @S.Anand,\nI successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel's free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project's size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.\nCould you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.\n\n\n<reply|169029/335>\nThe alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.",

Initially, I provided an ngrok link, but due to an error with ngrok, it stopped working. I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart. \nI hope you will consider my case.

I only changed the URL and made no other modifications. \nThank you for your understanding\n\n\n<reply|169029/343>\nHi @carlton \nThe same issue has affected several of us. During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini.\nIt seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs. \nWe just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\nWe hope this won\u2019t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.\nThank you\nLakshay",

As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately **50 to 60 seconds** to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both **Podman** and **Linux** environments.\nUpon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on **Railway** and submitted that link as well.\nIf possible, I kindly request either of the following:\n1. Re-evaluation using the **Railway link** I provided, or\n2. Re-evaluation using the **Render link**, with allowance for the 50\u201360 second activation time.\nYour consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.\nAlso just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.\nIf yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.\nKind regards\n\n\n<reply|171141/35>\nI suspect there is something wrong with how the evaluation has been done.

    "<original_post|171141/37>\n@Jivraj , @carlton \nIt was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the `os` library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as \"can't read the file.\"\nI understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.\nImage Description: \nThe image contains snippets of log files and the code, indicating the user is debugging a coding project. The log file shows HTTP errors such as \"500: [Errno 2] No such file or directory,\" and \"404 Not Found,\" suggesting file access issues. The code snippet from GitHub, likely the `app.py` file, shows the path handling logic, which the user admits to having initially commented out, causing the file reading errors. The user is seeking help on how to re-evaluate the code after fixing the issue.\n\n\n\n<reply|171141/59>\nHi @Pritul_raut \nNo, we won't reevaluating it.",
    "<original_post|171141/40>\nI noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.\nSince there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong\n\n\n<reply|171141/41>\n@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86.

Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.\nIf students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.\nWe have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation.

    "<original_post|171141/114>\n@carlton \nMy docker logs shows that `OSError: Cannot find resource` error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8. \nThe datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?\nI think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday's results mail.\nSo, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren't even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .\nAlso, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don't understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.\nThank you\nImage Description: \nThe image is a screenshot of the terminal output and a snippet from a Python script's `datagen.py` file. The terminal output shows a traceback, specifically highlighting an `OSError: cannot find resource` error, indicating a failure to access font files (Arial and DejaVuSans) during image generation. The user is likely encountering errors related to font availability, specifically when the script attempts to render images that rely on the specified fonts.

    "<original_post|171141/130>\nHi,\nFor Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.\nFor Task B1. \"Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.\" - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK\n```\nERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n```\nSimilarly for task B2.\n```INFO:main:structured_steps [{'name': 'file_folder_deletion', 'arguments': {'file_path': '/data/format.md'}}]\nINFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md\nERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n```\nFor Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as 'main' branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.\nFor Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?\nBecause I see only \"=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting\" for Task B8\n\n\n<reply|171141/178>\nCan someone from TA team reply to this?",

Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.\nIn fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? \n1. Because it does not deliver what was required,\n2. Wastes valuable time and resources\n3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)\n4. Complicates testing\n5. Leads to scope creep\nHis advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.\nI hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.\nFor personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).\nKindest regards",

There is also an error related to not being able to read the format.md file.

I kindly request you to review my submission again.\nAdditionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.\nGiven this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation.

    "<original_post|171141/285>\n@thinkmachine \nFirstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. :slight_smile: \n*However* with regards to your long post...\nLet me tell you a true story. I personally know a *very* experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.\nWhat you have done is what is called in industry as **gold plating**. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.\nIn fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? \n1. Because it does not deliver what was required,\n2. Wastes valuable time and resources\n3. Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)\n4. Complicates testing\n5. Leads to scope creep\nHis advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.\nI hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.\nFor personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).\nKindest regards",
    "<original_post|171141/285>\n<reply|171141/289>\nThanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It's a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would\u2019ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\nRegarding your point on gold plating \u2014 I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory \u2014 to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible **within the scope of the problem statement**.\nWhat began as just another (pun intended) _tedious_ assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. \ud83d\ude04\n_(...caution: long post ahead \ud83d\ude05)_\nI noticed that **test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use**. While it would've been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the **inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads**. No two payloads are exactly alike \u2014 even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There's also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.",
    "<original_post|171141/285>\nSome might suggest using `temperature=0` to get more deterministic LLM behavior \u2014 and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn't be helpful here as 4o-mini isn't all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There's only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\n**Hardcoded tool agents also aren\u2019t really \u201cagents\u201d in my view\u2014 they\u2019re more like passive AI powered regex matchers**: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to 'fix' them and keep calling them like a broken record.\nAt the core of it, it\u2019s all about **how much flexibility vs rigidity** we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between \u2014 The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\n- Reason about the task, understand intent,\n- Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\n- Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\n- Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.",
    "<original_post|171141/285>\n- Reason about the task, understand intent,\n- Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. *design* a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\n- Execute those workflows (*walk* the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\n- Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.\nInterestingly, a similar framework was suggested in [this ICLR 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn\u2019t need dozens of narrow tools \u2014 just a small, well-defined set of **general-purpose tools**:\n- A REPL executor (for quick calcs)\n- A Python script runner\n- A Shell executor\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally \u2014 avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) \u2014 that was **emergent behavior**, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I've yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. *Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!*\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. **Food for thought! Really!**\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I'll be experimenting with\u2014 modalities.",

At this point, I'm less concerned about the marks, I'm actually enjoying the thought joyride. \ud83d\ude04\n---\n**TL;DR**  \nMy approach doesn\u2019t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates \u2014 much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I\u2019ve only just wired the pieces together.\nKind regards",

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\nAction Taken\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\nRequest for Re-Evaluation",

I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\nPrevious Message for Reference\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\"Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest).

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\nAction Taken\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\nRequest for Re-Evaluation",

I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\nPrevious Message for Reference\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\"Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest).

    "<original_post|171141/393>\n<reply|171141/401>\n@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I\u2019m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn't going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students\u2014including myself\u2014it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I\u2019ve worked hard to demonstrate. \nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I\u2019m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties\u2014especially for a single oversight\u2014can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities.

    "<original_post|171141/421>\nDear @carlton \nThis is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the \n   `/app/app/main.py`     file is missing. However, in my project directory, the \n  `main.py`   file is located in the   `app/`   folder, and the   `run.py`   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   `LLM_Automation_Agent`  . This structure allows the `run.py` file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from `app/main.py`.\nTo run the project, the command I used is:\n```\npython run.py\n```\nSince `run.py` is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to `app/main.py`.\nI believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the `run.py` script located in the root folder (`llm-automation-agent`).\nFor your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.\nHere is the GitHub link to my project: \nhttps://github.com/ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent\n\nLookig forward towards your support.\nWith Regards\nK Senthur Kumaran\nImage Description: \nThe image is a screenshot showcasing a software development project named \"LLM_Automation_Agent\".

The terminal shows the execution of the `run.py` script, and the GitHub view shows the project's files, commits, and branches.

    "<original_post|171141/432>\n@carlton @Jivraj \nSir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.\nI actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn't even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow. \nEdit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/... \nBut my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.\nEdit 2:\nEven if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. \nThough an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya\nImage Description:",

The first snippet is a traceback related to a Python script (`datagen66ASRL.py`) failing to find font files (`arial.ttf` and `DejaVuSans.ttf`) while creating a credit card image, likely due to a missing font or an incorrect file path. The second snippet is a part of the `datagen.py` script that calls a series of functions, including `a8_credit_card_image()`. The error in `a8_credit_card_image()` likely prevents the following functions (`a9_comments()`, `a10_ticket_sales()`) from executing.\n\n\n\n<reply|171141/437>\nNoted your concerns wrt Edit 1 and Edit 2 (and datagen.py running latest python version): Will raise it with @s.anand during our Wednesday meeting. Once we have an update, we will inform you of the outcome.\nKind regards\n\n\n<reply|171141/451>\nI\u2019ve got good news for you and 30 other students. Thanks to your diligent debugging effort that we were able to find this bug. For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures.\nThanks and kind regards.\nWe will let you know the outcome of the evaluations soon.",

Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up).

    "<original_post|172246/23>\n<reply|172246/50>\nHi everyone,\nA bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\nFirstly students *vastly* overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. \nOnly 2 students managed it. \nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 *might* have even managed to get 3 or more marks. \n*So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.* The mean bonus score was 1.27. \nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\nThat is the data for you.\n### Also noteworthy \nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. \nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, \"at least you should let us know before GA7\". How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? \nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are *not* widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!",
    "<original_post|172246/23>\n**Bonuses are not a right.** They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:\n> Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.\nImage Description: \nThe image is a bar graph titled \"Student Bonus.\" The x-axis represents bonus marks, ranging from 0 to 5. The y-axis represents the number of students. The graph shows the distribution of bonus marks earned by students: 23 students earned 0 bonus marks, 36 earned 1 bonus mark, 50 earned 2 bonus marks, and only 2 students earned 3 bonus marks, while 0 students got a bonus of 4 or 5. The graph visually summarizes the distribution of bonus scores, emphasizing the low likelihood of achieving high bonus marks.",

    "<original_post|172246/28>\n<reply|172246/29>\nYes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. \nSince the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the **TDS course focuses more on teamwork** and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and **my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.** **They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE** release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.\nI understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn't submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.",

I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\nI\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them.

I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and **my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.** **They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE** release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.\nI understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn't submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.",

I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\nI\u2019d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you\u2019ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.\nThank you once again for your understanding.",

Don\u2019t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?\nIt\u2019s not about jealousy\u2014it\u2019s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.\nI\u2019m only concerned about **my own marks**, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.\nThank you for your time and understanding.\n@carlton @Jivraj",
    "<original_post|172246/34>\n<reply|172246/40>\nThanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement \u2014 which is fair.\nHowever, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so *not* for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.\nNow that bonus marks are announced *after* the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules \u2014 not for a lack of diligence or engagement.\nI'm not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others \u2014 and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.",
    "<original_post|172246/34>\n<reply|172246/41>\nSir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.\nIf the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. \nThe main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.\nSir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they **attended** GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. \nPlease think from our side.\nRegards\nKarthik\n\n\n<reply|172246/42>\n[quote=\"jkmadathil, post:34, topic:172246\"]\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks.

But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this. \nI think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks",

Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity\u2014not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.\nIf the bonus is truly a recognition of effort *specific to GA7*, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the **GA7 score** only, not in the **overall course total**, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.\nI know I\u2019m still learning and have a long way to go\u2014there\u2019s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college.

    "<original_post|172246/45>\n<reply|172246/46>\n@jkmadathil  @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj \nSir, as said in this another students' post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their \"diligence\" which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.\nShouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don\u2019t misunderstand our request as jealousy \u2014 it comes from a place of hardship.\nHow can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.\nJust because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students' interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment. \nRegards\nKarthik",
    "<original_post|172246/50>\nHi everyone,\nA bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\nFirstly students *vastly* overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. \nOnly 2 students managed it. \nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 *might* have even managed to get 3 or more marks. \n*So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.* The mean bonus score was 1.27. \nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\nThat is the data for you.\n### Also noteworthy \nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. \nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, \"at least you should let us know before GA7\". How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? \nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are *not* widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!",
    "<original_post|172246/50>\n**Bonuses are not a right.** They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:\n> Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.\nImage Description: \nThe image is a bar chart titled \"Student Bonus\" showing the distribution of bonus marks among students. The x-axis represents the bonus marks (0 to 5), and the y-axis represents the number of students. The bars indicate the number of students who received each bonus mark: 23 students received 0 bonus marks, 36 received 1, 50 received 2, and 2 received 3. No students received 4 or 5 bonus marks. This chart visualizes the distribution of bonus marks, highlighting the limited number of students who achieved high bonus scores.\n\n\n\n<reply|172246/51>\n@carlton \nCould you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given?",

While 2\u20133 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets\u2014aside from myself\u2014may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.\nAdditionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn't given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.\nGiven these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.",
    "<original_post|172246/52>\n<reply|172246/54>\nI am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don't see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.\n I hope the data is not being skewed because of the  total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.",

Search for existing containers on repositories such as dockerhub.\n2. Pull an existing docker image.\n3. Run that image inside a container. \n4. Enter to that container and modify something(such as installing python inside a ubuntu container, for customization or create some file)  \n5. Once done you can commit it. \n6. And push customized container's image to docker hub.\nRegarding local models running for project1, it's a good idea, we will see if it's possible to discuss in session.",

It outlines the required \"Deliverables,\" which involve creating a public GitHub repository, adding a LICENSE file, writing and testing code, using a Dockerfile, and publishing a Docker image to Docker Hub. The image highlights that the final step of the deliverable is submitting the GitHub repository URL and Docker image name in a Google Form.  The second image presents the \"Pre-requisites\" that need to be fulfilled for a project to be eligible for evaluation. The pre-requisites include the criteria for the repository to be existing, publicly accessible, having a license file, Dockerfile, and that the Docker image is publicly accessible and runs. The text emphasizes the importance of following these guidelines closely, failure to do so will result in failing the project.",

Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2. \nIn our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50\nAs to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\nIn short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.\nKind regards\nImage Description: \nThe image is a screenshot from a webpage about \"Large Language Models\" within the context of \"Tools in Data Science\". It highlights that LLMs incur a cost and specifies that users with an \"iitm.ac.in\" email have API keys with a usage limit of $1 per calendar month. The page also suggests using an AI Proxy instead of OpenAI and provides instructions on how to replace the API and API key. It is likely a resource or documentation for a course or project. The user's text alongside the image indicates that the user has exceeded their token limit, and the response is regarding this issue and is likely a response by someone from the teaching staff or course organizers.",

It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general *idea* of the task.\nThat said, `evaluate.py` is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\n**A word of caution:** *(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)* Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (*possibly your first task*) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.",

    "<original_post|164277/109>\nHi Telvin\nYou have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2. \nIn our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50\nAs to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ *(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)* for us!\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\nIn short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.\nKind regards\nImage Description: \nThe image is a screenshot of a webpage from the website `tds.s-anand.net`. The page discusses \"Large Language Models\" and mentions that using LLMs incurs a cost. The text highlights that users with an `iitm.ac.in` email have access to API keys, but their usage is limited to $1 per month. The image also suggests using an AI Proxy instead of OpenAI and provides instructions on how to replace API keys. This is likely a resource provided to students learning about LLMs.\n\n\n\n<reply|164277/110>\nThanks for your response, @Carlton.

The code defines functions, specifically `a2` and `a3`, which seem to handle email data and formatting.  Function `a2` uses `prettier` to format files, comparing the original and formatted content for any mismatches, returning `True` if they match.

    "<original_post|164277/297>\n\nImage Description: \nThe image shows a code snippet in a terminal, likely from a programming environment like VS Code. The code defines a function `handle_task_A2` that presumably uses a tool like \"prettier\" to format a file based on its path and a specified prettier version.  The image also shows a comparison of unformatted and formatted markdown content, indicated by the labels \"EXPECTED\" and \"RESULT\", respectively, demonstrating how the formatting tool is intended to work. The output section displays the expected and actual results after formatting, suggesting a test or verification of the formatting process. This implies that the user is trying to format the markdown file.\n\n\n\n<reply|164277/298>\nokay but in my docker image when i tried to run that in local, its asking for npx and it doesnt work\n\n\n<reply|164277/299>\n@carlton could you please give a hint as to why this isnt working\n\n\n<reply|164277/300>\nim running locally first and then will use docker when i get a 10/10 score",

An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.\nI am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.\nI beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.\nThank you for considering my heartfelt request.\nSincerely,\nRishit Jain\n(24F2004595)",

    "<original_post|164277/541>\nHi everyone,\nI'm running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:\nbash\nCopy\n```\nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings\n```\nI receive a **401 Unauthorized** response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a `KeyError: 'data'` because the expected JSON response doesn't include the `\"data\"` key.\n### What I've Tried\n1. **Token Verification:**\n  * I\u2019m using the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` obtained by logging in at [aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) with my IITM email.\n  * The token is passed in the header as follows:\npython\nCopy\n```\n\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\"\n```\n  * I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).\n2. **API Request Details:**\n  * The request includes the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.\n  * The payload is set as:\njson\nCopy\n```\n{\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]}\n```\n  * Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.\n3. **Debug Output:**\nHere\u2019s a snippet of the debug output:\nbash\nCopy\n```\nHTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\"\n\ud83d\udd34 A9 failed: 'data'\n```\nThis confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.\n### What I Suspect\n* The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.\n* There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I'm not aware of.\n* Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.\n### Request for Help\nHas anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance for your assistance!",

However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n[/quote]\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.",
    "<original_post|170147/3>\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n[quote=\"lakshaygarg654, post:1, topic:170147\"]\n**Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n[/quote]\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary.

    "<original_post|168832/120>\nRespected Sir,\nI noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term\u2019s project was tougher than the last.\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it's my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I'm actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.\nPlease consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted\nrollnumber 23f2001390\n\n\n<reply|168832/121>\nThe latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks.

The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday's Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards",

    "<original_post|168449/66>\nRespected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton \nBased on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.\nAs you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.\nI genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.\nYour understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nBest Regards,\nLakshay\n\n\n<reply|168449/67>\nYes sir it will be helpful for us\n\n\n<reply|168449/68>\nYes @carlton sir, please look into it and we request you to extend the allotted time.\n\n\n<reply|168449/70>\nYeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries.

    "<original_post|168476/9>\nThank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. \n1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this [Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84) where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the [first page of the TDS course](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\n> **This course is quite hard**\n>\n> Here\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\n>\n>* It *used* to be an easy course until 2024. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n>* Now it\u2019s hard and covers more.

It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - _Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help_\nAgain to quote Anand:\n> **We encourage learning by sharing**\n>\n>You *CAN* copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n>\n>**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\n>\n>**To learn well, understand** what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\n>\n>**To learn better, teach** what you\u2019ve learnt.\n3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).",

Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a [nice blog](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/) where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\n4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\n5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - _Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \"tools\", it is going to consume us an eternity to master them_ The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.",

All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn't be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

    "<original_post|168384/3>\nIt is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. \n*The problem is the lack of time.*\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards\n\n\n<reply|168384/9>\nHi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.",

    "<original_post|168303/3>\n@carlton \nIf possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.\n\n\n<reply|168303/4>\nProject 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. \nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. \nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards",

Or is the ROE more complex structured ? \nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\n\n\n<reply|168142/6>\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you... past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the \"hooomann\" :nerd_face:\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards",

    "<original_post|168142/7>\nIs there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?\n\n\n<reply|168142/8>\nDepends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

For example, [The Recruit](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/) is [also known as Graymail in India](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16030542/releaseinfo/?ref_=tt_dt_aka#akas). My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.\n**Why didn\u2019t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated?** Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It\u2019s never perfect.

So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn't work as well and throws the following error \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')\"\nWhat am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nBelow is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn't exist in the bbc database:\n{\n    \"2025-02-09\": \"Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-10\": \"Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-11\": \"Sunny and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-12\": \"Light snow and a fresh breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-13\": \"Light snow and a fresh breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-14\": \"Light snow and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-15\": \"Light snow and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-16\": \"Light snow and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-17\": \"Light cloud and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-18\": \"Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-19\": \"Light cloud and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-20\": \"Light cloud and a gentle breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-21\": \"Sunny and a moderate breeze\",\n    \"2025-02-22\": \"Light snow and a moderate breeze\"\n}\nImage Description:",

The main part of the image displays the expected output format (JSON) for weather data, exemplified with a sample for Nur-Sultan. The image also shows an error message \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')\", which is a probable error encountered when attempting to extract weather data for Nur-Sultan.\n\n\n\n<reply|165959/348>\nare you able do it now?

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n*  Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials.

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.\nWould it be possible to implement this change?",

    "<original_post|161120/50>\n<reply|161120/52>\n@23F300327 \nTypically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel's webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\nThat's why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n```\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return\n```\nNotice there is no `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` code block.\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.\n`if __name__ == \"__main__\":` is used to execute some code **only** if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.\nTry rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default `handler` class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. \nAnother possible problem:",

Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. \nAnother possible problem:\nBy default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues [TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)\nSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.\nLet us know what worked.

Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).\n3) The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes\nI also tried WebP with \"Lossless\" option selected and \"Effort\" increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.\nImage Description: \nThe image displays the user interface of the Squoosh image compression tool, showing the settings used for image compression.

Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\nThis renders `name == main` part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You *do not* create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\nThanks for your input.\nKind regards",

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\n\n\n<reply|166303/3>\nHi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nhttps://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30?si=fyL2ehtdjkxLWYvn&t=3133\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nhttps://youtu.be/3OdReZsvi2w?si=_LvLwTId3XvnlTWW\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nhttps://youtu.be/ELZf0n_0u9w?si=1ioLNdTrtn7ie02E\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",

    "<original_post|165922/2>\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\n1. **Isolation** \u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\n2. **Reproducibility** \u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\n3. **Portability** \u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\n---\n1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\n2. **Using requirements.txt**\n\u2022 Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\n**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**\n\u2022 If you **don\u2019t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\u2022 If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)**, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\n**Handling Version Conflicts**\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\u2022 Using **greater than/less than constraints**: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\n**Best Practices Summary**",

    "<original_post|170147/1>\n@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj \nDear TDS Team,\nI hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n### 1. Graded Assignments (GA)\n* **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)\n* **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n### 2. Project Updates\n* **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. \n* **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the *Project 2* discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?  [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)\n### 3. ROE Score Update\n* While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay",

However, in GA6, we moved to *Seek* and in GA7, to *Google Forms*. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n[/quote]\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.",
    "<original_post|170147/1>\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\n[quote=\"lakshaygarg654, post:1, topic:170147\"]\n**Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\n[/quote]\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\n[quote=\"lakshaygarg654, post:1, topic:170147\"]\n### 3. ROE Score Update",

With that in mind, i also tried the alternative\n`user_message = \"2 b7 rkS94mn4 \\n AM dNG4j EVevK24Ev VEpI G LeeHS\"`\nThe error message i keep receiving is as below.\nKindly advice on how to proceed.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini\n\n\n<reply|163247/49>\nHi Shalini,\nYour `user_message` is incorrect.

    "<original_post|163247/1>\n<reply|163247/122>\nSir, Regarding the embedding questions, I had posted earlier. Now, I am writing the error I faced. I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as \"The Maximum Quota has reached\". I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You",

The first screenshot displays a console log showing the successful execution of a search query, the creation of a collection, and the addition of documents. It also shows the search query and the matched documents returned. The second screenshot displays an error message indicating \"Got incorrect matches\". It also shows the user's attempted API endpoint and highlights it with an error indication.

    "<original_post|163247/1>\n<reply|163247/138>\nHello, I think the format of the response body should be like: { \"matches\" : [ \"ABC\", \"ABC\", \"ABC\"]}. I think it is because of your formatting issue.  \n  \nI had used (well gpt) the below two decorators to format:\n```\nclass SearchRequest(BaseModel):\n    docs: List[str]  # The list of documents to search through\n    query: str       # The search query string\nclass SearchResponse(BaseModel):\n    matches: List[str]  # The list of matched documents\n.........\n@app.post(\"/similarity\", response_model=SearchResponse)\n.........\nreturn SearchResponse(matches=sorted_matches[:3])\n```\nIt basically checks the Request  and Response formatting. This worked for me. Hope it helps. And thanks btw for mentioning using POSTMAN, as I had never used it before, so it clicked in my mind after reading your post only that I can basically debug using POSTMAN. Thank you for that \ud83d\ude00\nImage Description: \nThe image shows a screenshot of Postman, a tool used for testing APIs. It's a POST request to the \"/similarity\" endpoint on a local server (127.0.0.1:8000).  The \"Body\" section displays a JSON response with the key \"matches\" and an array of strings describing the API's returned results. The response indicates a successful (200 OK) status.

The user's final score before submitting was 6.5, which is lower than the score of 8.\n\n\n\n<reply|163247/141>\nThe score drops because some questions may require you to either keep a server turned on or some dynamic changes may occur for some questions (The dynamic changes are intentional in some questions, in order to get students to learn by doing. So if you solved everything and the score is the maximum... just make that your last submission.

    "<original_post|169029/1>\n<reply|169029/28>\n@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini \nDear Sir,\nI have few questions. It is written in the https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-2 that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don't think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n1. In GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI `gh`  which we have to install in the vercel instance using `apt` package manager. \nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\n2. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? \nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install `ngrok` package.\n3. In GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires `docker` package installed.\n4. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\n5. Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\n6. And many more\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. \nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n1. In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.",

In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\n2. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\n3. GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can't be installed locally.\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n1. In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\n2. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used \"Save as\" to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",
    "<original_post|169029/1>\n<reply|169029/34>\nHello Sir,\nI have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\n1. Currently answers that we have entered for GA's 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we've entered as well for verification purposes.\n2. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\n3. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\n4. How do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini\n\n\n<reply|169029/36>\n@Saransh_Saini @carlton \nSir is it possible to extend the deadline of this project 2 to Arpil.

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using `vicky_server.py`, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. `My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.`\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as \"question.pdf.\" How can I effectively manage this problem?\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word \"code\" and executes `first.py` for GA1.\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this project!\nBest regards,  \nvicky kumar\n@s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini \nmy model at [Vicky kumar tds](https://310c-43-230-107-168.ngrok-free.app/)",

Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?\nEdit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what's taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string.

But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. \u274c\nThen I thought\u2014what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a **static JSON structure**? That quickly broke when users passed **different parameters, different files**, or queried in **non-standard formats** like \"code -s\" or \"code -v\".\nThe next idea: write **individual Python scripts per question** from our Graded Assignments (GA1\u2013GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. \u274c\n---\n## \ud83d\udd27 The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n\u2705 Centralized engine in `vicky_server.py`\n\u2705 Uses **regex-based pattern matching** to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\n\u2705 Each solution is a structured Python function like `ga1_first_solution(query=None)`\n\u2705 Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\n\u2705 Acts like a **mini compiler for data science tools**\n---",

    "<original_post|171141/1>\nPlease post any discrepancies related to project1.\n@carlton \n## Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\n## How to fix bugs in our scripts \nCreate Pull requests to [Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1) .\n### **Docker Image Architecture Issue Report**\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\n[Submit Report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSerCpqod-5ArJWTW_QW5PenyfZJHH_cmcUw3s8dAoG3zDZm8g/viewform?usp=sharing)\n## Bug fixes\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix.

    "<original_post|171141/1>\n<reply|171141/72>\n@Jivraj @carlton \nI'm writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\n1. I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it's just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2\u00bd weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\n2. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn't receive a reply.\n3. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\n4. I also didn't receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.",

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between `pandas` and `numpy` caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (`pandas==2.0.3` and `numpy==1.24.3`) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (`santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest`). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation?

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn\u2019t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.\nNow I\u2019m seeing in groups that there\u2019s an \u201cextra benefit\u201d being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse.

    "<original_post|172246/1>\n<reply|172246/20>\n@carlton  @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand \nThe sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated \u201cbest 4 out of 7\u201d policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.\n\n\n<reply|172246/21>\n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand \nYes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn't complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.\nThank you\n\n\n<reply|172246/30>\nHello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time.\nI was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it.\n\n\n<reply|172246/31>\nI agree with all my peers.

We were not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and we have not received any mails regarding it.\nYou could have informed us beforehand. 5 marks really makes a huge difference. I trust you guys to make it fair for everyone\n\n\n<reply|172246/43>\nI wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades.\nAs outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.\nFor students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.\nGiven that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there's a possibility to consider an adjustment in these",

It lists a series of instructions for a project, including creating a GitHub repository, adding a license file, writing and testing code using specific API calls, creating and publishing a Docker image, and submitting the GitHub repository URL.

The terminal shows a POST request to an API endpoint, likely to trigger the LLM, along with the instructions to extract the card number and save it in a text file.  The output displays the expected and actual results, with a mismatch between them, indicating the LLM failed to extract the credit card number correctly. The user's text explicitly states that Open AI is not recognizing the credit card number correctly.",

The traceback also shows the file path where the error originated (`/tmp/evaluatewEpC39.py`) and the line number (20) where the import statement for the missing module is located.

The \"Code\" is 200, indicating a successful request. However, the \"Response body\" contains an error message: \"Could not understand the task.\" This suggests that the server encountered an issue when parsing or interpreting the query that the student submitted.

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure's voice emerged from the gloom, \"You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\"\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund's diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.",

    "<original_post|168476/1>\nDear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi \nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\n## **Key Challenges Faced**\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Lack of Prerequisites**\nThis course did not list any **prerequisites**, leading many students\u2014including those from **non-technical backgrounds**\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**\nThe **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**\nMany students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback**, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE**, which are significantly harder than anticipated.",
    "<original_post|168476/1>\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE**, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding.

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\n### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**\n* Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals**, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\n* The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\n* The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\n### **Request for Improvement**\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\n1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2**, well in advance of the deadline.\n2. **More structured and accessible support**, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.",

The user is navigating through the file system using the `ls` command to list the contents of the root directory (\"/\"). The command `sudo` is used before another command, which suggests the user is attempting to execute a command that requires administrative privileges. The prompt shows the user's current directory as /mnt/c/IIT_Madras/TDS_Project_1. The user's objective is to download a data folder, but is encountering a permission error.",
    "<original_post|167072/1>\n<reply|167072/2>\nHi Vikram,\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py \nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only... please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\n1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\n2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.\n3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\n4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: \nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\n5. Run evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards",

    "<original_post|165922/1>\nIs it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn't installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements.

    "<original_post|164205/1>\nI feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas.

Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\n I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

Where can you find them?\n- The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured.\n- Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find?\n\nThis will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet\nor within your organization or even within your phones.",

    "<course-content|archive>\nThe other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.\nStructured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.\nYou don't have to extract information from it.\nNumerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.\nSo you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.",
    "<course-content|archive>\n## Sample questions\n\n- Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines?

    "<course-content|base64-encoding>\n# Base 64 Encoding\n\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n- ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:",
    "<course-content|base64-encoding>\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:",
    "<course-content|base64-encoding>\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```html\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\n```\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n- JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n- Email: MIME attachments encoding\n- Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n- JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n- SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n- SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n- Git: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n- [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding\n- [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs",

Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI.",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Create a Sample Dataset\n\nLet's create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQL\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Create a Messy CSV\n\nLet's also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn't break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOF\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Create a Big CSV\n\nNext, we'll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB's streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQL\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nWe need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts.\n\n```sql\n-- Preview and get stats\nSELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;\nDESCRIBE orders;\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Converting Data to Other Formats\n\nLet's export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.\n\n```sql\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON);\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Reading Messy CSV\n\nWe need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB's error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers.\n\n```sql\n-- Skip bad lines while loading\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Handling Missing Values\n\nIt's important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\n\n```sql\n-- Replace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### String Operations\n\nIt's common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Date Parsing and Conversion\n\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Conditional Logic and Binning\n\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band\nFROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Regex Search and Replace\n\nWe often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can't handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality.\n\n```sql\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Working with Multiple Formats\n\nLet's combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB's format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json');\nCREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet');\nSELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Processing in Chunks\n\nWe handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns\n\nWe'll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Derived Columns\n\nNow, let's create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools.\n\n```sql\nSELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;\n```",
    "<course-content|data-preparation-in-duckdb>\n### Summaries and Pivots\n\nA big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\n```sql\n-- Aggregation\nSELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;\n\n-- Pivot by region\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nPIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));\n```\n\nUseful links:\n\n- [DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/)\n- [SQL Functions](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/overview)\n- [DuckDB Extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview)",

    "<course-content|embeddings>\n## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\n\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.",

    "<course-content|extracting-audio-and-transcripts>\n## Gemini transcription\n\nThe [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:\n\n1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\n2. They can handle audio input.\n\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\n2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\n3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.\n4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.",

This impacts image size a lot\n- **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n- **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n- **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n- **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n- Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n- Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:",

You should be able to see them on YouTube.\n\n**Q2: How should I approach TDS?**\n\n**A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n**Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-15>\n**Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?**\n\n**A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.\n\n**Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?**\n\n**A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.\n\n**Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?**\n\n**A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-15>\n**Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?**\n\n**A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.\n\n**Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?**\n\n**A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.\n\n**Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?**\n\n**A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n**Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-15>\n**Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**\n\n**A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.\n\n**Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?**\n\n**A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.\n\n**Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?**\n\n**A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.\n\n**Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?**\n\n**A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.",

The two diplomas complement each other.\n\n**Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?**\n\n**A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.\n\n**Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?**\n\n**A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.\n\n**Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?**\n\n**A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.\n\n**Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-15>\n**Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**\n\n**A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar.

The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session.\n\n**Q2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?**\n\n**A2:** The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube.\n\n**Q3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?**\n\n**A3:** The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question.\n\n**Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?**\n\n**A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.\n\n**Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?**\n\n**A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.\n\n**Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?**\n\n**A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.\n\n**Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?**\n\n**A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.\n\n**Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?**\n\n**A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.\n\n**Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?**\n\n**A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.\n\n**Q10: How do we start the project?**\n\n**A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.\n\n**Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q10: How do we start the project?**\n\n**A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.\n\n**Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?**\n\n**A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.\n\n**Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?**\n\n**A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).\n\n**Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?**\n\n**A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser.\n\n**Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?**\n\n**A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.\n\n**Q15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?**\n\n**A15:** The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server.\n\n**Q16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**\n\n**A16:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab.\n\n**Q17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?**\n\n**A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.\n\n**Q18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?**\n\n**A18:** The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure.\n\n**Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?**\n\n**A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs).\n\n**Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?**\n\n**A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction.\n\n**Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?**\n\n**A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable. Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work.\n\n**Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?**\n\n**A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#).\n\n**Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?**\n\n**A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array.\n\n**Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**\n\n**A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard.\n\n**Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?**\n\n**A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option.\n\n**Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**\n\n**A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change.\n\n**Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?**\n\n**A27:** Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element.\n\n**Q28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?**\n\n**A28:** No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements.\n\n**Q29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?**\n\n**A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.\n\n**Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.\n\n**Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?**\n\n**A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`.\n\n**Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?**\n\n**A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears.\n\n**Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears.\n\n**Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?**\n\n**A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally.\n\n**Q33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?**\n\n**A33:** npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file.\n\n**Q34: While showing `innerText`, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?**\n\n**A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability.\n\n**Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**\n\n**A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.\n\n**Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-16>\n**A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.\n\n**Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?**\n\n**A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them.",

Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.\n\n**Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-17>\n**Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?**\n\n**A2:** Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient.\n\n**Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?**\n\n**A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question.\n\n**Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?**",

The `diff` command shows the differences between two files directly. `git diff` compares commits in a git repository.\n\n**Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?**\n\n**A2:** Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot.\n\n**Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-23>\n**Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?**\n\n**A3:** I used a bash script that combines the `find` command (to locate files of a specific type, like `.txt` files) and the `mv` command (to move them). The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames.\n\n**Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?**\n\n**A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries.\n\n**Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-23>\n**Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?**\n\n**A5:** First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv <env_name>`. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).\n\n**Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-23>\n**Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?**\n\n**A6:** When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove `debug=True` from your Flask application before deploying to production.\n\n**Q7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?**\n\n**A7:** ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.\n\n**Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-23>\n**Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?**\n\n**A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\n\n**Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?**\n\n**A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages.\n\n**Q10: What is the assignment?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-23>\n**Q10: What is the assignment?**\n\n**A10:** Create a Flask application that takes a user's birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n# Live Session: 28 Jan 2025\n\n[![2025-01-28 Week 3 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/lmSMQ5LWa30/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30)\n\n**Q1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one?**\n\n**A1:** I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session.\n\n**Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?**\n\n**A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later.\n\n**Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?**\n\n**A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.\n\n**Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**\n\n**A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.\n\n**Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?**\n\n**A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.\n\n**Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?**\n\n**A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.\n\n**Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?**\n\n**A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.\n\n**Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**\n\n**A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.\n\n**Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?**\n\n**A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.\n\n**Q10: What's required for grading?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q10: What's required for grading?**\n\n**A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria:\n\n- It must exist and be publicly accessible.\n- It must have a license file (MIT license).\n- It must have a valid Dockerfile.\n- The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command.\n- The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.\n\nIt doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated.\n\n**Q11: What is the grading scheme?**\n\n**A11:** Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12.\n\n**Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?**\n\n**A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code.\n\n**Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?**\n\n**A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code.\n\n**Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?**\n\n**A14:** All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register.\n\n**Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?**\n\n**A15:** We'll cover this in a later session.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**A15:** We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n**Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?**\n\n**A16:** We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n**Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?**\n\n**A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.\n\n**Q18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?**\n\n**A18:** Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.\n\n**Q19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?**\n\n**A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.\n\n**Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**\n\n**A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n**Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?**\n\n**A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.\n\n**Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.\n\n**Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?**\n\n**A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n**Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?**\n\n**A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.\n\n**Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?**\n\n**A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.\n\n**Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?**\n\n**A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work.\n\n**Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?**\n\n**A26:** No, you don't have to pay.\n\n**Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?**\n\n**A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.\n\n**Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?**\n\n**A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then.\n\n**Q29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?**\n\n**A29:** Sure.\n\n**Q30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say \"yes\"?**\n\n**A30:** You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.\n\n**Q31: Why isn't it reflecting?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**A30:** You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.\n\n**Q31: Why isn't it reflecting?**\n\n**A31:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n**Q32: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**\n\n**A32:** For question 10, you need to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n**Q33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?**\n\n**A33:** Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs.\n\n**Q34: How do I get my API key?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q34: How do I get my API key?**\n\n**A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs.\n\n**Q35: What is a proxy?**\n\n**A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI.\n\n**Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?**\n\n**A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage.\n\n**Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?**\n\n**A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.\n\n**Q38: How are API calls made?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?**\n\n**A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.\n\n**Q38: How are API calls made?**\n\n**A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output.\n\n**Q39: Can you share the notebook file?**\n\n**A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available.\n\n**Q40: What about function calling?**\n\n**A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate.\n\n**Q41: What about embeddings?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q41: What about embeddings?**\n\n**A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session.\n\n**Q42: What about text extraction?**\n\n**A42:** We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n**Q43: What about Base64 encoding?**\n\n**A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API.\n\n**Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?**\n\n**A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n**Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-28>\n**Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?**\n\n**A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples.\n\n**Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.**\n\n**A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n# Live Session: 29 Jan 2025\n\n[![2025-01-29 Week 3 - Session 2 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/EPiVIP97fzI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/EPiVIP97fzI)\n\n**Q1: I am a student, and I joined the session without using my IITM ID. How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?**\n\n**A1:** You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID.\n\n**Q2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?**\n\n**A2:** Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic.\n\n**Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?**\n\n**A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?**\n\n**A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.\n\n**Q4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.**\n\n**A4:** That would be great.\n\n**Q5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?**\n\n**A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)\n\n**Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?**\n\n**A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in `Flask` in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.)",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A8:** Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there'",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response.\n\n**Q9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)**\n\n**A9:** Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.)",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**\n\n**A10:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\n\n**Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**\n\n**A11:** There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn't give you a problem anymore.\n\n**Q12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A12:** The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word `class` itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called `class` (CLASSS) without the underscore.\n\n**Q13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A13:** Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add `/api`. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the `requests` module instead of the `curl` command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n**Q14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.**\n\n**A14:** Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn't cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it.\n\n**Q15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I'm giving the URL, but it's giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I'll show you. Should I run this first?**\n\n**A15:** Add `/api` at the end of that. That's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There's some logic error. You're getting a Cloudflare error. That's something to do with the CDN service giving some sort of response. We'll have to check with Anand.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**\n\n**A16:** At the moment, it's working, right? There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse.\n\n**Q17: I'm getting an error from this. I don't know how...**\n\n**A17:** In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**\n\n**A18:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\n\n**Q19: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A19:** It looks like a Cloudflare error. I've noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error.\n\n**Q20: Should I install it separately?**\n\n**A20:** No, you won't require requirements for it. Vercel is able to run the program without that.\n\n**Q21: For Vercel, I will take the example code and try to run it. One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A21:** You should use the requests module and send a request using headers and all those informations. What you are using is actually OpenAI's own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n**Q22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How?**\n\n**A22:** This was a really fascinating question. There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well.\n\n**Q23: Can I get the code for this?**\n\n**A23:** He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it.\n\n**Q24: I've taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don't submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.**\n\n**A24:** Right, right.\n\n**Q25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I'm also getting a very similar error. I couldn't follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end. Shall I share my screen?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**A25:** Just before you share your screen, was it giving you a Cloudflare error? (The student describes the error.) You can share your screen. I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error. The instructor then suggests using the directly executable file for ngrok.)\n\n**Q26: I tried all this, same issue. I'm getting an error. I think I've tried all this, same issue.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-29>\n**Q26: I tried all this, same issue. I'm getting an error. I think I've tried all this, same issue.**\n\n**A26:** The account is limited to one simultaneous session. You've got another session running somewhere. I think that is inside VS WSL. You'll have to stop that. You'll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It's generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for... can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There's a problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself.",

The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?**\n\n**A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.**\n\n**A3:** Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one.\n\n**Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?**\n\n**A4:** Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the `requirements.txt` file. You can use a single-line command in Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment).\n\n**Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.**\n\n**A5:** Let's try `python -m venv venv` in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library.\n\n**Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?**\n\n**A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign.\n\n**Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.**\n\n**A7:** I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API.\n\n**Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).**\n\n**A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n**Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n**Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?**\n\n**A9:** Exactly. That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your `requirements.txt` file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, `uv` is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.\n\n**Q10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.**\n\n**A10:** Your server is not running. Run `vercel deploy --prod` again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code.\n\n**Q11: I'm using httpx.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q11: I'm using httpx.**\n\n**A11:** Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the `requirements.txt` file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code?\n\n**Q12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add `/api` to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.**\n\n**A12:** That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add `../` before `q` to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q13: Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy?**\n\n**A13:** No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n**Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?**\n\n**A14:** No, they are in the `vercel-python/api` directory.\n\n**Q15: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name in question 9.**\n\n**A15:** `class` is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means.\n\n**Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?**\n\n**A16:** You need to use lists. Import `List` from the `typing` library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias.\n\n**Q17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.**\n\n**A17:** You are using `httpx`. You're also using `index.py`. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server.\n\n**Q18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.**\n\n**A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.\n\n**Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.\n\n**Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.**\n\n**A19:** Can you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added `/api` to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure.\n\n**Q20: I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.**\n\n**A20:** Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n**Q21: Show your folder structure.**\n\n**A21:** I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.\n\n**Q22: If I use `uv`, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?**\n\n**A22:** Yes.\n\n**Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**A22:** Yes.\n\n**Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?**\n\n**A23:** I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git.\n\n**Q24: Can we use the query function?**\n\n**A24:** Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi.\n\n**Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?**\n\n**A25:** That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. `values` will return this.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q26: Question 9: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name.**\n\n**A26:** `class` is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias.\n\n**Q27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?**\n\n**A27:** Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me.\n\n**Q28: Can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**\n\n**A28:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. `httpie` is a command-line tool, not a Python module. I'm not sure about `httpie`.\n\n**Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**\n\n**A29:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.\n\n**Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?**\n\n**A30:** You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array.\n\n**Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?**\n\n**A31:** Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face.\n\n**Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**\n\n**A32:** I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.\n\n**Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?**\n\n**A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\".\n\n**Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**\n\n**A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course.\n\n**Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.**\n\n**A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD.\n\n**Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?**\n\n**A36:** You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work.\n\n**Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?**\n\n**A37:** I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle.\n\n**Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**\n\n**A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.\n\n**Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?**\n\n**A39:** We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only.\n\n**Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**\n\n**A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about `httpie`. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the `requests` module.\n\n**Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?**\n\n**A41:** That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape.\n\n**Q42: Does it involve SVD?**\n\n**A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-30>\n**Q42: Does it involve SVD?**\n\n**A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.\n\n**Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.**\n\n**A43:** You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\". That's how computers store this information.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n# Live Session: 31 Jan 2025\n\n[![2025-01-31 Week 3 - Session 4 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sdg4N-H4BR0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sdg4N-H4BR0)\n\n**Q1: In today's session, what will be covered?**\n\n**A1:** We will be discussing the function calling part of OpenAI. We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function.\n\n**Q2: What is the first step in the process?**\n\n**A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request.\n\n**Q3: What is the goal of the program?**\n\n**A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders.\n\n**Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n**Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?**\n\n**A4:** The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format.\n\n**Q5: What are the predefined functions?**\n\n**A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt.\n\n**Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?**\n\n**A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n**Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?**\n\n**A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.\n\n**Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?**\n\n**A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells.\n\n**Q9: How is the JSON response handled?**\n\n**A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.\n\n**Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n**Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?**\n\n**A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.\n\n**Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?**\n\n**A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.\n\n**Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?**\n\n**A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.\n\n**Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?**\n\n**A13:** Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n**Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?**\n\n**A14:** The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using `json.loads` to convert strings to JSON objects.\n\n**Q15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?**\n\n**A15:** The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It's recommended to save your work frequently.\n\n**Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?**\n\n**A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters.\n\n**Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?**\n\n**A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-01-31>\n**Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?**\n\n**A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys.\n\n**Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application?**\n\n**A19:** The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n# Live Session: 01 Feb 2025\n\n[![2025-02-01 Week 3 - Session 5 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tsn7B7mDzw8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/tsn7B7mDzw8)\n\n**Q1: Can I use Python notebooks instead of VS Code for this project?**\n\n**A1:** You can use Python notebooks for interactive development and debugging, but for a production environment, a script file (.py) is better because it allows for a defined order of execution, unlike notebooks where code cells may not necessarily branch from one section to another. Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step.\n\n**Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?**\n\n**A2:** That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors.\n\n**Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?**\n\n**A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.\n\n**Q4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?**\n\n**A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?**\n\n**A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.\n\n**Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?**\n\n**A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling.\n\n**Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?**\n\n**A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.\n\n**Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?**\n\n**A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that:\n\n- The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function.\n- The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time).\n- The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity).\n- You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`).\n\n**Q9: How do I use Docker?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**Q9: How do I use Docker?**\n\n**A9:** Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.\n\n**Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?**\n\n**A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\n\n**Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-01>\n**Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?**\n\n**A11:** The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n# Live Session: 04 Feb 2025\n\n[![2025-02-04 Week 4 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8A7Z_PN_PzQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8A7Z_PN_PzQ)\n\n**Q1: I'm having trouble with question 7 of the GA3 assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request, but it keeps showing \"method not allowed\".**\n\n**A1:** When you access a URL from a browser, it sends a GET request. To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.\n\n**Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.**\n\n**A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.\n\n**Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.\n\n**Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?**\n\n**A3:** Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces `{}`. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button.\n\n**Q4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?**\n\n**A4:** Yes, you are. Since you don't have a `.env` file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with `return \"hello\"` to test. Restart the server.\n\n**Q5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.**\n\n**A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).\n\n**Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?**\n\n**A6:** Recently.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).\n\n**Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?**\n\n**A6:** Recently.\n\n**Q7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?**\n\n**A7:** T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T\n\n**Q8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?**\n\n**A8:** Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy.\n\n**Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.**\n\n**A9:** Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client.\n\n**Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?**\n\n**A10:** Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.\n\n**Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.**\n\n**A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.\n\n**Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.**\n\n**A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.\n\n**Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?**\n\n**A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.\n\n**Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.\n\n**Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?**\n\n**A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.\n\n**Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**\n\n**A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.\n\n**Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?**\n\n**A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process.\n\n**Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).**\n\n**A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.\n\n**Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?**\n\n**A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.\n\n**Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?**\n\n**A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks.\n\n**Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.**\n\n**A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.\n\n**Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.\n\n**Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?**\n\n**A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.\n\n**Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?**\n\n**A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs.\n\n**Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?**\n\n**A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.\n\n**Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?**\n\n**A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.\n\n**Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.\n\n**Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?**\n\n**A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.\n\n**Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?**\n\n**A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.\n\n**Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?**\n\n**A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.\n\n**Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?**\n\n**A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-04>\n**Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?**\n\n**A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.\n\n**Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**\n\n**A30:** You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.\n\n**Q31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**\n\n**A31:** Officially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning.\n\n**Q32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say \"yes\"?**",

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.\n\n**Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?**\n\n**A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.\n\n**Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?**\n\n**A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.\n\n**Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?**\n\n**A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-06>\n**A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).\n\n**Q5: How does the `IMPORTHTML` function automatically find the table?**\n\n**A5:** It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly.\n\n**Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?**\n\n**A6:** There are three ways:",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-06>\n**Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?**\n\n**A6:** There are three ways:\n\n- **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly.\n- **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID.\n- **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.\n\n**Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?**\n\n**A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element.",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-06>\n**Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?**\n\n**A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element.\n\n**Q8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".**\n\n**A8:** When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).\n\n**Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-06>\n**Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?**\n\n**A9:** The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting.",

However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.\n\n**Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?**\n\n**A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.\n\n**Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?**\n\n**A3:** First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.\n\n**Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?**\n\n**A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key.\n\n**Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?**\n\n**A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.\n\n**Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.\n\n**Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?**\n\n**A6:** Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States).\n\n**Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?**\n\n**A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.\n\n**Q8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?**\n\n**A8:** If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values.\n\n**Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?**\n\n**A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method.\n\n**Q10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?**\n\n**A10:** Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.\n\n**Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?**\n\n**A11:** Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it's more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame.\n\n**Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?**",
    "<course-content|live-session-2025-02-07>\n**Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?**\n\n**A12:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g., `span` elements with a specific class) and extract the text content.

    "<course-content|llm-agents>\n## LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act\n\nLLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\n[![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)\n\n### What Makes an Agent?\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\n1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\n- Observe the environment\n- Think about what to do\n- Take action using tools\n- Observe results\n- Repeat until task completion",
    "<course-content|llm-agents>\n### Command-Line Agent Example\n\nWe've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that:\n\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```bash\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\n```\n\nThe agent will:\n\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:",
    "<course-content|llm-agents>\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\n- Planning (generating code)\n- Execution (running the code)\n- Reflection (interpreting results)\n- Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)\n\n### Agent Architectures\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\n1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\n2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\n3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\n4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps",
    "<course-content|llm-agents>\n### Real-World Applications\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\n1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code\n3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions\n5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks",
    "<course-content|llm-agents>\n### Project Ideas\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\n1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\n2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\n3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\n4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\n5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations\n2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable\n3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\n4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency\n5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent",
    "<course-content|llm-agents>\n### Limitations and Challenges\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\n1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\n4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks\n5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management",

    "<course-content|llm>\n### Practical Uses\n\n- **Automated coding**. Generate code scaffolding, review helpers, or utilities on demand. For example, after running`llm install llm-cmd`, run `llm cmd 'Undo the last git commit'`. Inspired by [Simon\u2019s post on using LLMs for rapid tool building](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/).\n- **Transcript processing**. Summarize YouTube or podcast transcripts using Gemini. See [Putting Gemini 2.5 Pro through its paces](https://www.macstories.net/mac/llm-youtube-transcripts-with-claude-and-gemini-in-shortcuts/).\n- **Commit messages**. Turn diffs into descriptive commit messages, e.g. `git diff | llm 'Write a concise git commit message explaining these changes'`. \\\n- **Data extraction**. Convert free-text into structured JSON for automation. [Structured data extraction from unstructured content using LLM schemas](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/).",
    "<course-content|marimo>\n## Interactive Notebooks: Marimo\n\n[Marimo](https://marimo.app/) is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.\n\nMarimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.\n\nIt also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n```python\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\n```\n\nBest Practices:",

    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n## Parsing JSON\n\nJSON is everywhere\u2014APIs, logs, configuration files\u2014and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n[![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:",

    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### Command-line JSON Processing with jq\n\n[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n**Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n```bash\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\n```",
    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### JMESPath Queries\n\n[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n**Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n```python\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\n```",
    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### Streaming with ijson\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\n```",
    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### Pandas JSON Columns\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\n```",
    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### SQL JSON Functions\n\n[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html),\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html).\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n**Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\n```",
    "<course-content|parsing-json>\n### DuckDB JSON Processing\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\n```",

    "<course-content|project-1>\n## Background\n\nYou have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\n\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain\u2011English tasks, carries out the required (multi\u2011step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre\u2011computed expected results.",
    "<course-content|project-1>\n## Create an API\n\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\n\n- **POST `/run?task=<task description>`**\n  Executes a plain\u2011English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\n  - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n- **GET `/read?path=<file path>`**\n  Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\n  - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body",
    "<course-content|project-1>\n## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:",
    "<course-content|project-1>\n- **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\n- **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place\n- **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`\n- **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json`\n- **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first",
    "<course-content|project-1>\n- **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first\n- **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`)\n- **A7**. `/data/email.txt` contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt`\n- **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`",
    "<course-content|project-1>\n- **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`\n- **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line\n- **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`\n\nDevelopers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.\n\nFor example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.",

    "<course-content|project-1>\n## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:\n\n- **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it\n- **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it\n\nThe DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:\n\n- **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it\n- **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit\n- **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database\n- **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website\n- **B7**. Compress or resize an image\n- **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file\n- **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML\n- **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data\n\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.",
    "<course-content|project-1>\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.\n\nThe business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.",

    "<course-content|project-1>\n- **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We _may_ pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.\n- **Bonus: Code diversity**. You're encouraged to copy code and learn from each other. We encourage diversity too. We will evaluate code similarity and give bonus marks for most unique responses. (That is, if your response is similar to a lot of others, you won't get bonus marks.)\n\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it's 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.\n\nThis execution will be automated via:\n\n- [`validate.py`](project-1/validate.py) to check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible `images.txt`\n- `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` to set the AI Proxy token\n- [`run.sh`](project-1/run.sh) to evaluate all submissions.",

Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you\u2019ll get.\n> For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy.",

This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_\n\n  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._\n  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._\n\n  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model.

    "<course-content|prompt-engineering>\n### Prefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n- **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.)\n\n> Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five...\u2019. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.",
    "<course-content|prompt-engineering>\n### Ask for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n- **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.",
    "<course-content|prompt-engineering>\n### Use proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n- **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer.

    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain\u2011specific questions without fine\u2011tuning.\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren\u2019t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!\n```",
    "<course-content|rag-cli>\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-book\n```\n\n- `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\n- `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.\n\nYou'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.",
    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks\n\n```bash\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.json\n```",
    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n- `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories.

    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n- `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.\n\nYou'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n### 3. Generate embeddings\n\n```bash\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json\n```\n\n- `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`.\n- `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n- `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model.\n- `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend.\n- `--format nl`: input is newline\u2011delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)\n\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.\n\n```bash\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection\n```",
    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n### 4. Find similar topics\n\n```bash\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\n\n- `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n- `-n 3`: return three results.\n- `-c`: the user\u2019s query string.",
    "<course-content|rag-cli>\n### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\\n  | jq '.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\nThis answers the question in natural language following these steps:\n\n1. Store the query in `Q`.\n2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.\n3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets.\n4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:\n   - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.\n   - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded.\n5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.",

    "<course-content|vector-databases>\n## Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.\n\nUse vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.)\n\nVector databases are an evolving space.\n\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:",

    "<course-content|vercel>\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)",
    "<course-content|vercel>\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n- You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n- You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n- You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)",
